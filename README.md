# Crypto Finder

An application to search for and get information about crypto currencies.

## Live Version

[Crypto Finder](https://finder-app-tau.vercel.app/)

## Details

This application was built after remaking one of the previous projects from the React course on Udemy. Initial version is available [here](https://github-finder-chi-ten.vercel.app/) and its repository is [here](https://github.com/Dimterion/Github-finder).

The app allows to type the name of the crypto currency, get a list of all possible ones matching it and see general information about each one (price, overview, markets data, etc).

Overall, in comparison to the initial version, I've used the CoinGecko API, adjusted the responsiveness for the mobile version and added some styling changes for the individual currencies pages.

Due to the API change, I also needed to change the structure of the requests to get the right data and to display it correctly.

## Built with

React, React Router, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS
